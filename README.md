# syntaxx-team
**We have made this repository so you can lay you issues, and make collaborations too, concerning syntaxx.**
**You can support us through victoryosiobe on kofi: ***https://ko-fi.com/victoryosiobe***.**

We are working on syntaxx to see how we can get it to actually reply like a chatbot.

Do you know you can solve some less complex maths with syntaxx, type something like solve 5+2 or #math 6/7 or #math 5-7Ã—1000+6Ã·2000+9 or solve âˆš4. cos, tan and sin are currently under development. Even the square root you see there, you can now do something like 2Ã— âˆš25 and 2âˆš25. we said we'd work on it sooner, and we did.

Syntaxx makes use of simple IndexedDB to store chats on your browser, and retrieves it when needed, like when you reload the page or enter again after a long time. You can delete your chat sessions when needed, just by clicking on the 3 dots on the navigation bar with black background, where you see syntaxx written. It's at the left. Do note that we don't use anyones data, but it is adviced not to put personal or private information to syntaxx, because of the not-so-hard ways hackers can hijack browser data!

Use syntaxx for fun, but with caution ðŸ¤–.
